# RASA Chatbot Integrated with ChatGPT

To Run  = rasa run


Overview :

The purpose of this project is to build a chatbot that can interact with users and provide them with helpful information or assistance. The chatbot will be integrated with ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, to enable it to generate natural and engaging responses to user queries.

To accomplish this goal, we will use the RASA framework, an open-source platform for building conversational AI chatbots. RASA provides a set of tools and libraries for training and deploying chatbots that can understand natural language and engage in human-like conversations.

In addition to RASA, we will also leverage the power of the OpenAI API to access ChatGPT's advanced language processing capabilities. With OpenAI, we can integrate advanced natural language understanding and response generation capabilities into our chatbot, making it more intelligent and capable of providing more useful and relevant responses to user queries.

Overall, this project will involve developing a fully functional chatbot that can engage in natural and meaningful conversations with users, powered by the advanced language processing capabilities of ChatGPT and the OpenAI API. This chatbot can be used in a wide range of applications, such as customer service, support, or information retrieval, to provide users with quick and helpful assistance.
